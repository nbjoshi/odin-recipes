        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Chicken shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish consisting of marinated chicken that is slow-roasted on a vertical rotisserie. 
            The chicken is typically marinated in a mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, and a variety of spices such as cumin, coriander, 
            paprika, turmeric, and cinnamon. This combination of ingredients gives the meat a flavorful and aromatic profile. </p>
        <p>As the chicken cooks, it is shaved off the spit in thin slices and usually served in a warm pita or flatbread. It is commonly
            accompanied by toppings and sauces such as tahini, garlic sauce, hummus, pickles, tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce. Chicken
            shawarma is often enjoyed as a wrap or sandwich, but it can also be served on a platter with rice or salad. This dish is known for
            its juicy, tender meat and its vibrant, rich flavors, making it a beloved street food and a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine.</p>
