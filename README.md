This is my first project in The Odin Project curriculum.
Although I already have experience with HTML and CSS, I'm starting from the basics so I can make sure I have a good foundation and can work on projects.
The three foods I chose were: Chicken Shawarma, Strawberry Cheesecake, and Eggpland Parmesan.
